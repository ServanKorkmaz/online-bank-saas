🏦 I want to build a **full-featured account management page** for my FintechOS web app, similar to the experience in Norwegian banks like DNB, Sparebank 1, Nordea, or Sbanken.

🎯 The goal is to:
1. Allow the user to **create new accounts** of different types
2. Show a **clean and professional overview of all their accounts**
3. Include realistic **interest terms and account conditions** for each account type

---

🧩 Account Creation Page Features:

Users should be able to create any of the following accounts:

### ✅ 1. Regular Savings Account (`Sparekonto`)
- Interest: ~1.5% p.a.
- Withdrawals: Unlimited
- Intended for saving with flexibility

### ✅ 2. Fixed-Interest Deposits (`Fastrenteinnskudd`)
- User chooses binding period:
  - 3 months: ~3.25% interest
  - 6 months: ~3.75% interest
  - 12 months: ~4.2% interest
- Funds locked during binding period
- Early withdrawal penalty applies

### ✅ 3. Everyday Account (`Brukskonto`)
- 0% interest
- Unlimited transactions
- Primary for payments, salary, etc.

### ✅ 4. Tax Deduction Account (`Skattetrekkskonto`)
- 0% interest
- Restricted access – only for tax withholding
- Must be marked for compliance

📄 Each account type should:
- Show the conditions before confirming creation
- Include minimum deposit (e.g. 500 NOK for fixed-term deposits)
- Include date of account creation and current balance
- Save accounts in user’s session (or mock DB)

🖥️ Account Overview Page:
- Display all accounts in a **dashboard-style view**
- For each account, show:
  - Account name & type
  - Account number (mocked)
  - Current balance
  - Interest rate
  - Date opened
  - Next interest payout (if applicable)

📊 Bonus:
- Show **total balance across all accounts**
- Allow user to **filter by account type**
- Clicking an account should open a **detail view** with:
  - Transaction history (mocked)
  - Interest history (if savings/fixed deposit)
  - Option to export as PDF/CSV

---

🎨 Design & UX Requirements:
- Built with **React or Next.js**
- Styled with **TailwindCSS**
- Use **Framer Motion** for smooth transitions (e.g. when opening a new account)
- Clean, modern UI — like DNB or Sbanken
- Fully responsive design (mobile + desktop)
- Accessible (a11y best practices)

---

🧠 Additional Logic:
- Do not allow user to open multiple skattetrekkskonto unless explicitly confirmed
- Fastrentekonto must show binding period end date
- Optionally simulate interest accrual per month (mocked logic)
- Generate mock account numbers for realism

---

🛠️ Tech Stack:
- React/Next.js frontend
- TailwindCSS UI
- Zustand or Context API for account state
- Supabase/PostgreSQL (optional) for persistent data
- Export tools: jsPDF, CSV-stringify

---

✅ Final Result:
A **fully working account creation + overview experience**, integrated in my FintechOS dashboard. It should feel professional, trustworthy, and functionally identical to what real Norwegian banks provide today.
