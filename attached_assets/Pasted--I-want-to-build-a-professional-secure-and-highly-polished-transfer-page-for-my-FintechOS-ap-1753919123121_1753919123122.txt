💸 I want to build a **professional, secure, and highly polished transfer page** for my FintechOS app – at the same level of usability and trust as DNB, Nordea, or Sbanken.

🎯 Goal:
Create a full-featured transfer page that lets users choose between:
1. **Transfer within Norway**
2. **Transfer to abroad (International)**

Each flow should reflect real-world Norwegian banking standards (e.g., IBAN, KID, BIC/SWIFT, recipient info, etc.).

🧩 Core Features:

🔘 Step 1: Transfer Type Selection
- Radio buttons or tabs: `Norway` / `International`

---

### 🇳🇴 Domestic (Norway) Transfer Form:
- Recipient name
- Account number (11 digits)
- KID or message (with validation)
- Amount (NOK)
- Date (default: today)
- Optional: "Save recipient" toggle

✔️ Validate:
- Account number format (mod11 control check)
- KID optional but validated if provided

---

### 🌍 International Transfer Form:
- Recipient name
- Country selector (dropdown)
- IBAN or account number
- BIC/SWIFT
- Currency (EUR, USD, GBP, etc.)
- Amount (in local or foreign currency)
- Exchange rate (static or via API placeholder)
- Message to recipient
- Delivery time estimate (optional)

✔️ Validate:
- IBAN format
- SWIFT/BIC format
- Show currency conversion preview

---

🛡️ Security & Best Practices:
- Include confirmation step before transfer is processed
- Use masked inputs and real-time validation
- Show warning for incorrect/unsupported formats
- Add "Transfer summary" page before submit
- Use secure form handling and CSRF protection

---

🎨 UI/UX Design Requirements:
- Match Norwegian bank design conventions (clean, minimal, serious)
- Use TailwindCSS or similar utility-first system
- Add subtle animations (Framer Motion) to make transitions smooth
- Include tooltips/icons for unclear fields (e.g., "What is BIC/SWIFT?")
- Responsive layout (mobile + desktop)

---

🛠️ Tech Stack:
- **Frontend:** React or Next.js (preferred)
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS
- **State:** React Hook Form or Zustand
- **Backend API:** Placeholder/mock (you can integrate later with payment processor)
- **Data validation:** Yup or Zod schema-based validation

---

📦 Deliverables:
- Full transfer page UI with both domestic and international flows
- All input fields validated with proper UX
- Optional “Saved recipients” sidebar
- Transfer summary modal or page before submission
- Prepared to plug into real transfer APIs later

---

🧪 Extra:
- Add dark mode switch
- Use mock exchange rate API (like fixer.io or static rates)
- Add “Favorite transfer” or “Frequent recipient” memory for better UX

✅ Outcome:
A modern, secure, and enterprise-quality money transfer page that users will recognize and trust – identical in feel and function to what they'd find in a Norwegian bank app.
