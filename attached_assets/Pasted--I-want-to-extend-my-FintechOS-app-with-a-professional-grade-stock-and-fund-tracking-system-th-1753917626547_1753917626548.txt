📈 I want to extend my FintechOS app with a **professional-grade stock and fund tracking system** that:
- Shows **live market data** (quotes, changes, trends)
- Allows users to **favorite specific stocks/funds**
- Is beautifully designed, extremely intuitive, and **psychologically engaging**

🎯 Purpose:
Create a stock and mutual fund dashboard that makes users feel connected to the market. It must be **addictive to check daily**, like a mini Bloomberg terminal mixed with Revolut-style UX.

---

🧩 Core Features:
- 📊 Live stock and fund prices (real-time or 15-min delayed)
- 🔍 Search bar to find stocks (via name or ticker)
- ⭐️ Favorite system (users can star and unstar assets)
- 📈 Sparkline mini-charts showing performance over time
- 🧠 Personalized feed: “Your Favorites Today”, “Biggest Movers”, “Trending Now”
- 🌍 Show assets from multiple regions (US, EU, NO, etc.)

---

🧠 Psychology & Engagement:
- Use subtle color gradients, motion (Framer Motion), and **gamified micro-interactions**
- Highlight daily/weekly trends with positive reinforcement (“Your portfolio outperformed 65% of users today”)
- Daily notification tile in UI: “Markets opened 6 min ago. 3 of your favorites are in green.”

---

🛠️ Technical Requirements:

**Frontend:**
- Built in **React or Next.js** (same stack as FintechOS)
- Styled using **TailwindCSS**
- Use **Framer Motion** for animations and engaging transitions
- Modular layout for:
  - Market overview
  - Favorite assets
  - Individual asset detail pages

**Backend/Data:**
- Mock data first using local JSON or Supabase
- Later use public APIs like:
  - Yahoo Finance (via RapidAPI)
  - EOD Historical Data API
  - Finnhub or Twelve Data (freemium)
- Store user favorites in PostgreSQL (via Supabase or Replit DB)

**Authentication & Personalization:**
- Reuse existing **FintechOS login session**
- Show personalized data per user (favorites, last viewed)
- No need for buy/sell — tracking only

📦 MVP Features (Phase 1):
- Stock/fund overview page with sample data
- Favorite system (UI + local DB)
- Asset detail view with chart and info

🧪 MVP Features (Phase 2 – optional):

- Add “watchlist alerts” (price thresholds)
- Weekly summary email or UI card

---

🧩 Integration:
This module must be embedded into the main **FintechOS** dashboard.
- Add a sidebar/menu item: “Markets”
- Reuse existing auth and theme system
- Data should be scoped to user session

---

✅ Result:
A fully working, beautiful and addictive stock/fund dashboard for Norwegian fintech users. Simple, clean, and highly engaging. No trading functionality needed — tracking only.
